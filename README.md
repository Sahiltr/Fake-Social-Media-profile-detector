# Fake Social Media Profile Detection

This repository contains code for a machine-learning model designed to detect fake social media profiles. Fake profiles can be a significant problem on social media platforms, leading to issues such as misinformation, fraud, and security threats. This model aims to help mitigate these problems by automatically identifying suspicious profiles.

## Introduction

In this project, we develop a machine-learning model using Logistic Regression Algorithm to classify social media profiles as genuine or fake. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of social media profiles, where each profile is annotated as real or fake based on various features such as profile picture, activity, and user information.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the files. It consists of 576 of labeled social media profiles, each represented by features such as profile picture quality, post frequency, and account age.

## Preprocessing

Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for training. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture was developed using the Logistic regression algorithm, followed by the implementation of the k-cross-validation technique to mitigate any potential bias.

## Training

The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using various parameters like followers, posts, following etc. The training involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the classification loss function.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance detecting fake social media profiles. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score measure the model's effectiveness.

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt).
2. Download and preprocess the dataset using the provided scripts (if applicable).
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation script.
5. Use the trained model for detecting fake social media profiles by providing profile features as input.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation are as follows:

- Accuracy: [accuracy]
- Precision: [precision]
- Recall: [recall]
- F1-score: [F1-score]

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements to the model include:

- Experimenting with different model architectures.
- Collecting more diverse and comprehensive datasets.
- Incorporating additional features such as social network structure and user behavior.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
